        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Music:</strong> Training in classical, folk, and contemporary music, including vocal and instrumental performances.</li>
          <li><strong>Dance:</strong> Classes and performances in classical, folk, and modern dance forms.</li>
          <li><strong>Drama:</strong> Theatrical productions that explore social themes and showcase acting skills.</li>
