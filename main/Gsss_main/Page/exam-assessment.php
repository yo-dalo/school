        <p>
          The exam and assessment system at <span class="highlight">GSSS Senior Secondary School</span> is designed to evaluate studentsâ€™ academic progress while promoting a stress-free and holistic approach to learning. Our system aligns with [Insert Board, e.g., CBSE] guidelines and focuses on continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE).
        </p>

        <h3>Assessment Structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Formative Assessments (FA):</strong> Regular class tests, quizzes, projects, and assignments to monitor ongoing progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Summative Assessments (SA):</strong> Term-end examinations to evaluate overall learning outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Co-Scholastic Assessments:</strong> Evaluation of life skills, attitudes, and participation in co-curricular activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Examination Schedule</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Periodic Tests: Conducted [e.g., monthly/quarterly] to assess subject-wise understanding.</li>
          <li>Mid-Term Exams: Held halfway through the academic year.</li>
          <li>Annual Exams: Conducted at the end of the academic year for Classes I-XII.</li>
          <li>Board Exams: For Classes X and XII, as per [Insert Board] guidelines.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We provide detailed feedback to students and parents after each assessment, ensuring transparency and opportunities for improvement. Our focus is on fostering a growth mindset, where assessments are seen as tools for learning rather than just evaluation.
